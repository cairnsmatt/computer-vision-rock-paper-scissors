> This project aims to use a [Teachable Machine model](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and Python to create a video-based game of ['Rock, Paper, Scissors'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors). 

## Milestone 1
- Image data was captured using a web camera for four classes: *Rock*, *Paper*, *Scissors* and *Nothing* (a blank image). 200 images were captured for each class.
- The Teachable Machine model was then trained on the four classes, using the default settings.
- Prior to downloading the files, the performance of the model was tested.  This involved recapturing images for one of the classes, which was not well-recognised.
- The files were downloaded using the default settings from the `Tensor` tab.

After downloading the files, the `keras_model.h5` and `labels.txt` files were staged, committed and pushed to the remote repository.
